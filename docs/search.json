    "text": "How to Use This Resource\nNote: This version of the problem set is a review copy for in-class piloting. This is not the final, published version of the problem set.\nThe navigation bar of this site will allow you to browse to the specific problems you want to view and solve. The Problem Submission App enables you to create your own unique problem used to solve homework problems. Once your problem is generated, you will be able to submit an answer to the problem and receive instantaneous right/wrong feedback before attempting another solution. At the end of your work, you can download a file log of your submissions to share with your instructor. The problem generation process is based on the ID number you use and so if you attempt the problem from a different computer or at a different time, the variables generated for you will be stable across these runs. However, the log downloader is specific to your current session and so attempting the problem across devices does not save attempt across devices\nAdditionally, there are versions of the problems with fixed variables that do not use the Problem Submission App. These are available to you also in the sidebar should you want a more traditional textbook listing of problems.\nIf you have any questions or issues while using this system, you are encouraged to contact your instructor and they will help work through the issues with the developers.",
